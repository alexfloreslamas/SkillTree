## Usage

### Running the Python script

- Open the command-line interpreter and navigate to the folder `SkillTree/`
- Type the following command:



```terminal
python 3.10 main.py
```



In the above example, we call the `main.py` file with the information stored in the `SkillTree/Input/Skills.yml` file. The **HTML** file generated by the script is in the `SkillTree/Output` folder.



### The `SkillTree/Input/Skills.yml` file

This will file contain all the configurations and contents for your Skill Tree diagram. You can edit the **YML** file and replace the demo content with your own.

- The `network_config:` section includes all the information settings for visualising your skills.
- Below the **# Modify/Add skills below here** comment, you can add as many skills and sub-skills as needed; follow the pattern in the demo.
